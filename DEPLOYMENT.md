        WORKDIR /app
        COPY . /app
        RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
        CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app/app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.enableCORS=false"]

3. Build and run the container:

        er build -t disease-prediction .
        docker run -p 8501:8501 disease-prediction

4. Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser to access the app.

## ðŸ“Œ 3. Deploying on a Virtual Private Server (VPS)

You can deploy this project on AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or DigitalOcean.

### Steps to Deploy on VPS:

1. Set up a Virtual Machine (VM) running Ubuntu.

2. Install Python and Streamlit:

        sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
        sudo apt install python3 python3-pip -y
        pip install streamlit

3. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-prediction.git
        cd disease-prediction
        pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Streamlit app:

        streamlit run app/app.py --server.port=8501 --server.enableCORS=false

5. Access the app by opening [http://your-server-ip:8501](http://your-server-ip:8501) in your browser.


## ðŸ“Œ 4. Running the App Locally

If you don't want to deploy online, you can run the app locally:

    streamlit run app/app.py

This will start a local server, and you can access the app in your browser.


## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

- For quick deployment â†’ Use Streamlit Cloud.
- For containerized deployment â†’ Use Docker.
- For full control â†’ Use a VPS (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean).
